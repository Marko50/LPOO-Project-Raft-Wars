To install the app on a android phone just move the apk file: "android-release.apk" located in the android directory to your phone by connecting it to your computer. Once done just go to your android file explorer and locate the apk, then press it and install it. Ensure that your mobile phone allows the installation of third party applications. For the development environment, just pull the content of this branch onto a local directory and add it to your designated IDE.
